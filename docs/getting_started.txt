Getting Started
===============

To get started using ``django-taggit`` simply install it with
``pip``::

    $ pip install django-taggit


Add ``"taggit"`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

Run `./manage.py syncdb` or `./manage.py migrate` if using migrations.

.. note::

    If you are using South you'll have to add the following setting, since
    taggit uses Django migrations by default::

      SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
          'taggit': 'taggit.south_migrations',
      }

And then to any model you want tagging on do the following::

    from django.db import models

    from taggit.managers import TaggableManager

    class Food(models.Model):
        # ... fields here

        tags = TaggableManager()

Optionally, taggit can help you prevent similar tags from being created, by
trying to match new tags to existing tags based on the slugs that are
generated for each. With this option enabled, an existing tag of "Foo Bar"
with slug "foo-bar" will be used if a user enters "foo-bar","foo BAR", FOO
BAR", etc, instead of creating a new tag with slug "foo-bar_1". To enable this
slug matching add the following setting:

   TAGGIT_SLUG_MATCHING = True
